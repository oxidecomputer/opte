= Running OPTE Benchmarks on a Gimlet (pair)

The kernel module benchmarks can be run on a pair of lab gimlets connected over their `cxgbe` interfaces.
Today, SN9/SN14 are set up in this configuration.

== Image construction
When https://github.com/oxidecomputer/helios[building a helios image], we need to include some extra packages and pull in the latest (host-installed) version of OPTE.
After following instructions to setup Helios and build illumos, a Helios image suitable for running `kbench` can then be built using the command:

[source, bash]
----
./helios-build experiment-image \
  -F extra_packages+=/network/test/iperf \
  -F extra_packages+=/system/library/demangle \
  -F extra_packages+=/ooce/developer/flamegraph \
  -F optever=0.31.264 \
  -B -N netperf
----

The version of opte installed here is unimportant, as we will often be using local unpublished binaries and modules for testing.
This image may then be installed onto your bench gimlet(s) as standard.

== Running kbench on a bench gimlet

Bench gimlets will not have cargo or rust installed, so typically we will need to locally compile these artifacts on a Helios/illumos machine and transfer these artifacts onto the gimlet ramdisk:

 - the `xde` kernel module -- `target/x86_64-unknown-unknown/release/xde`
 - `opteadm` -- `target/release/opteadm`
 - the `kbench` binary.

All three artifacts require a consistent API version.

The first two are stored in a static location, however see link:README.adoc#in-situ-measurement[the README entry on in-situ measurement] to acquire the current path for the third entry.
This `cargo bench ... --message-format json-render-diagnostics` invocation will return a path such as:

[source,json]
----
[
  "/develop/gits/opte/target/release/deps/xde-5f922c3588d78a41"
]
----

=== Installing and running artifacts

Assuming all components have been `rsync`/`scp`'d into `/tmp`, we run on both machines:

[source, bash]
----
cd /tmp
rem_drv xde
cp xde /kernel/drv/amd64/
----

On SN9:

[source, bash]
----
./kbench server -u cxgbe0 cxgbe1 -b omicron1
----

On SN14:

[source, bash]
----
./kbench remote 172.20.2.109 -u cxgbe0 cxgbe1 -b omicron1
----

`opteadm` invocations for inspecting state or, e.g., manually configuring the underlay can then be made using `/tmp/opteadm [args]`.
