//! Types for calculating the internet checksum.
//!
//! This module contains types for calculating the "internet
//! checksum". The [`Checksum`] type provides a rolling one's
//! complement checksum, allowing one to more efficiently build up (or
//! incrementally update) a sum before finalizing it into a
//! [`HeaderChecksum`], which is the value stored in the actual header
//! bytes.
//!
//! # Checksums and Endianness
//!
//! It's easy to become confused by endianness and networking code
//! when looking at checksums. It's worth making clear what is going
//! on.
//!
//! Any logical value stored in a network header needs to consider
//! endianness. A multi-byte value like an IP header's "total length"
//! or TCP's "port", which has a logical value like "total length =
//! 60" or "port = 443", needs to make sure its value is interpreted
//! correctly no matter which byte order the underlying hardware uses.
//! To this effect, all logical values sent across the network are
//! sent in "network order" (big endian) and then adjusted accordingly
//! on the host. For example, AMD64 arch network code calls
//! `hton{s,l}()` to convert the logical value in memory to the
//! correct byte order for the network, and uses `ntoh{s,l}()` to
//! convert in the other direction. However, not all values have a
//! logical, numerical meaning. A MAC address is made up of six
//! consecutive bytes, for which the order is important. This string
//! of bytes is never interpreted as an integer. There is no
//! conversion to be made. The bytes are in the same order in the
//! network as they are in memory (because the logical value is just
//! that, a sequence of bytes). The same goes for the various
//! checksums. The internet checksum is just a sequence of two bytes.
//! However, in order to implement the checksum (one's complement
//! sum), we happen to treat these two bytes as a 16-bit integer, and
//! the sequence of bytes to be summed as a set of 16-bit integers.
//! Because of this it's easy to think of the checksum as a logical
//! `u16` when it's really not. This brings us to the point: you never
//! perform byte-order conversion on the checksum field. You treat
//! each pair of bytes (both the checksum value itself, and the bytes
//! you are summing) as if it's a native 16-bit integer. In C this
//! takes the form of a direct cast to `(uint16_t *)`, in Rust it's
//! `{to,from}_ne_bytes()`. Yes, this means that on a little-endian
//! architecture you are logically flipping the bytes, but as the
//! bytes being summed are all in network-order, you are also storing
//! them in network-order when you write the sum to memory.
//!
//! While said a slightly different way, this is also covered in RFC
//! 1071 ยง1.B.
//!
//! > Therefore, the sum may be calculated in exactly the same way
//! > regardless of the byte order ("big-endian" or "little-endian")
//! > of the underlaying hardware. For example, assume a "little-
//! > endian" machine summing data that is stored in memory in
//! > network ("big-endian") order. Fetching each 16-bit word will
//! > swap bytes, resulting in the sum \[4\]; however, storing the
//! > result back into memory will swap the sum back into network
//! > byte order.
