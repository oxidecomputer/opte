# XXX: This is a hack in order for the integration tests to run. The
# integration tests concern themselves with the behavior of the engine
# code, and we would like to enable that feature without requiring the
# developer to always pass `--features=engine` explicitly.
#
# You might think it would be nice if one could somehow specify that a
# given integration test relies on a given feature, and you would not
# be alone, as there is an open issue for just such a feature:
