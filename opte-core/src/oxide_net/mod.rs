//! The Oxide Network configuration.
//!
//! This module contains configuration that is specific to the "Oxide
//! Network" -- i.e., the underlay/overlay that we implement on an
//! Oxide Rack. OPTE itself is a generic engine for performing packet
//! transformations in a flow-centric manner. While it does provide
//! primitve building blocks for implementing network functions, like
//! rules and header transpositions, it does not dictate a specific
//! network configuration. This module configures OPTE in a manner
//! consistent with the definition of The Oxide Network [^rfd63].
//!
//! This should probably be in its own crate, separate from OPTE
//! itself. For now keeping it here is convenient.
